# Development Notes

## Code Style & Best Practices

### General

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write comments for complex logic
- Use TypeScript for better type safety
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle

### Frontend

1. **Component Structure**

   - Use functional components with hooks
   - Keep components small and reusable
   - Implement proper prop validation
   - Use proper file naming conventions

2. **State Management**

   - Use React Context for global state
   - Keep state as local as possible
   - Implement proper error boundaries
   - Use proper loading states

3. **Styling**
   - Follow BEM naming convention for CSS
   - Use Tailwind utility classes efficiently
   - Maintain responsive design principles
   - Keep styles modular and reusable

### Backend

1. **API Design**

   - Follow RESTful conventions
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Use meaningful HTTP status codes
   - Validate all incoming data

2. **Database**

   - Use proper indexing for performance
   - Implement data validation
   - Keep database queries optimized
   - Use proper error handling for DB operations

3. **Security**
   - Sanitize all user inputs
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Use proper authentication/authorization
   - Keep sensitive data encrypted

## Git Workflow

### Branching Strategy

```
main
  └── development
       ├── feature/user-auth
       ├── feature/job-crud
       └── bugfix/cors-issue
```

### Commit Messages

- Format: `type(scope): message`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
- Example: `feat(auth): implement user login`

### Pull Request Process

1. Create feature branch from development
2. Make changes and test
3. Submit PR to development
4. Get code review
5. Merge after approval

## Testing Strategy

### Frontend Testing

- Unit tests for components
- Integration tests for pages
- E2E tests for critical flows
- Test coverage > 80%

### Backend Testing

- Unit tests for services
- Integration tests for APIs
- Load testing for performance
- Security testing

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend

- Lazy loading for routes
- Image optimization
- Bundle size optimization
- Caching strategies

### Backend

- Database query optimization
- API response caching
- Rate limiting
- Load balancing

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Tools

- Sentry for error tracking
- MongoDB Atlas monitoring
- Server logs analysis
- Performance metrics

### Metrics to Track

- API response times
- Error rates
- Database performance
- User engagement

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment

- Run all tests
